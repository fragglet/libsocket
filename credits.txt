The following people have contributed to libsocket.  The list is in no
particular order.  A big thank you to all those listed!

   * Dan M. Hedlund `http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/8523/'


     His Wsock library is the base of this library.


   * Alfons Hoogervorst `http://www.hoogervorst.demon.nl/'


     His dsock library helped Indrek to get select() and blocking
     recv() calls work.  He also contributed some information on how to
     obtain Windows machine and DNS IP addresses.


   * The Regdos Group `http://www.hoogervorst.demon.nl/'


     They contributed the registry-access code that is used to
     automatically find out some IP settings.  Alfons is the maintainer.


   * Michael Callahan, Peter Braam and the Coda Project
     `http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/'


     For Win95 port of the Coda network file system, a VxD for BSD
     socket networking was produced.  This enabled me to add Winsock 2
     support to libsocket.  This is something I had been trying to do
     for over a year, so I am extremely grateful and happy that this
     has happened! Big thanks.   - _Rich_


   * Heiko Jappe


     He has a very nice habit of finding all the nastiest bugs and
     reporting them.  There would be some very bad "features" in the
     library without him. - _Indrek_

   * Wojciech Galazka


     He pointed out some bugs and has some great ideas.  A man with an
     open mind. - _Indrek_ - I agree - _Rich_


   * Indrek Mandre `http://www.pld.ttu.ee/~indrek/'


     Thanks to Indrek for writing the library in the first place,
     letting me contribute to it, and then, gulp, trusting me to look
     after it.  This man has a lot faith and trust!  Thanks also for
     providing a mirror site.   - _Rich_


   * Petr Frisch


     Thanks to Petr for finding that libsocket's non-blocking sockets
     didn't work properly, and for informing me how they should work. -
     _Rich_


   * Vlad Pambucol


     Thanks to Vlad for noticing that his data was being mangled by
     libsocket, which lead to me finding an absolutely _huge_ bug! -
     _Rich_


   * Philippe Hanrigou


     Thanks to Phillipe for trying to port BSD traceroute, finding
     problems and then diving into libsocket's internals to find out
     the problem.  Bravery!  Thanks for the feedback. - _Rich_


   * Ove Kaaven


     Thanks to Ove for providing me with information about how Windows
     3.11 stores its DNS IP addresses.  Thanks for your packet driver
     code - sorry I was unable to integrate it into libsocket. - _Rich_


   * Michael Mauch


     Thanks to Michael for pointing out that the resolving code didn't
     open the files in text mode, which meant that setting fmode to
     binary could lead to the resolving code failing inexplicably. -
     _Rich_


   * Alex Fiori


     Thanks for providing a mirror site for a while. - _Rich_


   * Federico Bianchi


     Thanks for sending me a *huge* amount of networking information.
     I hope I actually have enough time at some point to something
     useful with it ;) Thanks for the support and ideas! - _Rich_


   * Alain Magloire


     Thanks for all the advice on sockets on Unix, POSIX, etc.  Thanks
     for motivating me to add Unix domain socket support.  I think
     libsocket will improve and prosper greatly with your support! -
     _Rich_


   * Beej `http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~beej/'


     Thanks for letting me distribute your sockets programming guide
     with libsocket. - _Rich_


   * Jason Winnebeck `http://skyscraper.fortunecity.com/solarcity/552/'


     Thanks for being patient, giving me copious debugging info and
     feedback generally! - _Rich_


   * Eli Zaretskii


     For his continual advice and help with all things DJGPP - an
     inspiration.


   * DJ Delorie


     For the DJGPP phenomenom!


Thanks to everyone else who has shown interest in libsocket, and has
mailed me to say they are using it.  Please continue to do this!
