man2html History
================

man2html Copyright 1997, 1998 by Richard Dawe

Version 1.2 - 1998-6-9
----------------------

- Added the '-1' switch to allow output of all converted man pages into one
  HTML file with the index.

- man2html now uses the Perl 5 modules FileHandle and DirHandle. Hence it
  requires Perl 5.

- Added '--htm' alias for '-htm' switch, and '--index' alias for '-idx' switch.

- Wrote some proper documentation.

Version 1.1 - 1998-5-2
----------------------

- Added the '-htm' switch to output files with ".htm" extension.

- Output HTML files no longer have "<name>.<man section>.htm[l]" form. The
  <man section> was removed as this contained in the directory name of the
  directory the HTML file resides in.

- Added the '-idx:<index name>' switch to specify the stem of the index's
  filename.

- man is now supplied with the section number, so pages with the same name
  in different sections will be converted properly (previously the same output
  would be generated for both pages).

Version 1.01
------------

- Fixed the bug which omitted a 'Z' entry in the index.

- Added hyperlinks for 'dodgy' translations to a translation issues page.

- Added some basic help.

Version 1.0
-----------

- First version.
