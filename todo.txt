libsocket To-dos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list is in no particular order:

- DOS support using Watt-32 code;

- socketpair() support for all interfaces, not just Unix domain sockets;

- IPX support;

- Finish/further developing of the test suite;

- DXE support or other dynamic-linking mechanism;

- Better Windows IP address discovery code (one that works for all links),
  rather than the complex registry, RAS and VDHCP.VXD magic currently used;

- Add routing table code.

- Proper out-of-band (OOB) data support - currently this is very weak /
  inconsistently supported.
