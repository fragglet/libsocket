diag.c
------

This program prints out the following diagnostic information about libsocket's
configuration:

- Host name
- Domain name
- Configuration directory
- DNS servers
- Supported interfaces - Winsock 1 (wsock), Winsock 2 (csock), Unix domain
  sockets (unix), etc.
- Support protocols - TCP/IP streams, UDP/IP datagrams, etc.

This can be useful, if libsocket is not working. If you encounter a problem
with libsocket, please mail the author the output of this program - see
the contact details below.

netproto.c
----------

This program looks up protocols by name, e.g. "tcp", "udp".

netserv.c
---------

This program looks up services by name, e.g. "smtp", "ftp".

netnet.c
--------

This program looks up networks by name.

client.c & server.c, clientn.c & servern.c
------------------------------------------

These client and server demos show basic socket programming. The 'n' versions
use non-blocking I/O. These non-blocking versions can do work while waiting
for data.

httpget.c, httpgetn.c
---------------------

These programs get a web page from a server, given the URL, e.g.

    httpget http://www.yahoo.com/

The (unprocessed) contents of the web page are printed. httpgetn is a
non-blocking version. They are only suitable for retrieving text files -
don't use it to retrieve binary files, because they will be truncated.

resit.c
-------

This is a simple name resolver, which maps names like 'www.yahoo.com' to an
IP address. This can be used to check that the DNS servers are set up
correctly. Try:

    resit www.yahoo.com

select.c
--------

This program demonstrates the basic use of select with files, but not sockets.
However, the principle is the same with sockets.

ioctl.c
-------

This program demonstrates libsocket's limited support of some BSD-ish and
Linux ioctls. If you don't know what this means, don't worry. The program
will dump low-level details about libsocket's supported interfaces.

solist.c
--------

This program lists the socket options supported for TCP/IP and UDP/IP sockets,
along with their value. This may be useful if you're trying to port a program
and you need to know if you can use a certain socket option.

unixcli.c, unixserv.c
---------------------

These client and server programs test libsocket's support of Unix domain
sockets over Windows mailslots.
