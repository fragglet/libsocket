.TH PROTOCOLS 5 "18 October 1995" "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
protocols \- the protocols definition file
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file is a plain ASCII file, describing the various DARPA internet
protocols that are available from the TCP/IP subsystem. It should be
consulted instead of using the numbers in the ARPA include files, or,
even worse, just guessing them. These numbers will occur in the
protocol field of any ip header.

Keep this file untouched since changes would result in incorrect ip
packages. Protocol numbers and names are specified by the DDN Network
Information Center.

Each line is of the following format:

.RS
.I protocol number aliases ...
.RE

where the fields are delimited by spaces or tabs. Empty lines and
lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. Remainder of lines
are also ignored from the occurrence of a hash mark.

The field descriptions are:

.TP
.I protocol
the native name for the protocol. For example ip, tcp or udp.
.TP
.I number
the official number for this protocol as it will appear within the ip
header.
.TP
.I aliases
optional aliases for the protocol.
.LP

This file might be distributed over a network using a networkwide
naming service like Yellow Pages/NIS or BIND/Hesoid.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/protocols
