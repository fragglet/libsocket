.TH GETHOSTBYNAME 3  "April 19, 1993" "BSD" "Linux Programmer's Manual"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgethostbyname()\fP function returns a structure of type \fIhostent\fP
for the given host \fIname\fP.  Here \fIname\fP is either a host name, or
an IPv4 address in standard dot notation, or an IPv6 address in colon
(and possibly dot) notation. (See RFC 1884 for the description of IPv6
addresses.) If \fIname\fP doesn't end in a dot 
and the environment variable \fBHOSTALIASES\fP is set, the alias file
pointed to by \fBHOSTALIASES\fP will first be searched for \fIname\fP.
(See
.BR hostname (7)
for the file format.)
The current domain and its parents are searched unless \fIname\fP
ends in a dot.  
.PP
The \fBgethostbyaddr()\fP function returns a structure of type \fIhostent\fP
for the given host address \fIaddr\fP of length \fIlen\fP and address type
\fItype\fP.  The only valid address type is currently AF_INET.
.PP
The \fBsethostent()\fP function specifies, if \fIstayopen\fP is true (1), 
that a connected TCP socket should be used for the name server queries and 
that the connection should remain open during successive queries.  Otherwise, 
name server queries will use UDP datagrams.
.PP
The \fBendhostent()\fP function ends the use of a TCP connection for name
server queries.
.PP
The \fBherror()\fP function prints the error message associated with the
current value of \fIh_errno\fP on stderr.
.PP
The domain name queries carried out by \fBgethostbyname()\fP and
\fBgethostbyaddr()\fP use a combination of any or all of the name server
\fBnamed\fP(8), a broken out line from \fI/etc/hosts\fP, and the Network
Information Service (NIS or YP), depending upon the contents of the
\fIorder\fP line in \fI/etc/host.conf\fP.  (See
.BR resolv+ (8)).
The default action is to query \fBnamed\fP(8), followed by
\fI/etc/hosts\fP.
.PP
The \fIhostent\fP structure is defined in \fI<netdb.h>\fP as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf
.ne 7
.ta 8n 16n 32n
struct hostent {
	char	*h_name;		/* official name of host */
	char	**h_aliases;		/* alias list */
	int	h_addrtype;		/* host address type */
	int	h_length;		/* length of address */
	char	**h_addr_list;		/* list of addresses */
}
#define h_addr	h_addr_list[0]		/* for backward compatibility */
.ta
.fi
.RE
.PP
The members of the \fIhostent\fP structure are:
.TP
.I h_name
The official name of the host.
.TP
.I h_aliases
A zero-terminated array of alternative names for the host.
.TP
.I h_addrtype
The type of address; always AF_INET at present.
.TP
.I h_length
The length of the address in bytes.
.TP
.I h_addr_list
A zero-terminated array of network addresses for the host in network byte
order.
.TP
.I h_addr
The first address in \fIh_addr_list\fP for backward compatibility.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBgethostbyname()\fP and \fBgethostbyaddr()\fP functions return the
\fIhostent\fP structure or a NULL pointer if an error occurs.  On error,
the \fIh_errno\fP variable holds an error number.
.SH "ERRORS"
The variable \fIh_errno\fP can have the following values:
.TP
.B HOST_NOT_FOUND
The specified host is unknown.
.TP
.B NO_ADDRESS
The requested name is valid but does not have an IP address.
.TP
.B NO_RECOVERY
A non-recoverable name server error occurred.
.TP
.B TRY_AGAIN
A temporary error occurred on an authoritative name server.  Try again
later.
