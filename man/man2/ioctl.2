.TH IOCTL 2 "23 July 1993" "BSD Man Page" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
ioctl \- control device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/ioctl.h>
.sp
.BI "int ioctl(int " d ", int " request ", ...)"
.sp
[The "third" argument is traditionally \fBchar *\fIargp\fR, and will be so
named for this discussion.]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ioctl
function manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files.  In
particular, many operating characteristics of character special files
(e.g. terminals) may be controlled with
.B ioctl
requests.  The argument
.I d
must be an open file descriptor.

An ioctl
.I request
has encoded in it whether the argument is an
.I in
parameter or
.I out
parameter, and the size of the argument
.I argp
in bytes.  Macros and defines used in specifying an ioctl
.I request
are located in the file
.IR <sys/ioctl.h> .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 0.7i
.B EBADF
.I d
is not a valid descriptor.
.TP
.B ENOTTY
.I d
is not associated with a character special device.
.TP
.B ENOTTY
The specified request does not apply to the kind of object that the
descriptor
.I d
references.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I Request
or
.I argp
is not valid.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
No single standard.  Arguments, returns, and semantics of
.BR ioctl (2) 
vary according to the device driver in question (the call is used as a
catch-all for operations that don't cleanly fit the Unix stream I/O
model). See 
.BR ioctl_list (2)
for a list of many of the known 
.B ioctl
calls.  The
.B ioctl
function call appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
