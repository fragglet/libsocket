.TH GETDOMAINNAME 2 "22 July 1993" "Linux 0.99.11" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getdomainname, setdomainname \- get/set domain name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int getdomainname(char *" name ", size_t " len );
.br
.BI "int setdomainname(const char *" name ", size_t " len );
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to access or to change the domain name of the
current processor.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
For
.BR getdomainname ,
.I name
points to
.B NULL
or
.I name
is longer than
.IR len .
.TP
.B EPERM
For
.BR setdomainname ,
the caller was not the superuser.
.TP
.B EINVAL
For
.BR setdomainname ,
.I len
was too long.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX does not specify these calls.
.SH BUGS
.B getdomainname
is not compliant with other implementations, since they always return
.I len
bytes, even if
.I name
is longer.  Linux, however, returns
.B EINVAL
in this case (as of DLL 4.4.1 libraries).
.SH NOTES
Under Linux,
.B getdomainname
is implemented at the library level by calling
.BR uname (2).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR gethostname "(2), " sethostname "(2), " uname (2)
