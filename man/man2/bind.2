.TH BIND 2 "23 July 1993" "Linux 0.99.11" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
bind \- bind a name to a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.sp
.BI "int bind(int " sockfd ", struct sockaddr *" my_addr ", int " addrlen );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bind
gives the socket,
.IR sockfd ,
the local address
.IR my_addr .
.I my_addr
is
.I addrlen
bytes long.  Traditionally, this is called "assigning a name to a socket"
(when a socket is created with
.BR socket (2),
it exists in a name space (address family) but has no name assigned.)
.SH NOTES
Binding a name in the UNIX domain creates a socket in the file system
that must be deleted by the caller when it is no longer needed (using
.BR unlink (2)).

The rules used in name binding vary between communication domains.  Consult
the manual entries in section 4 for detailed information.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 0.8i
.B EBADF
.I sockfd
is not a valid descriptor.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The socket is already bound to an address.  This may change in the future:
see
.I linux/unix/sock.c
for details.
.TP
.B EACCES
The address is protected, and the user is not the super-user.
.TP
.B ENOTSOCK
Argument is a descriptor for a file, not a socket.
.PP
The following errors are specific to UNIX domain (AF_UNIX) sockets:
.TP 0.8i
.B EINVAL
The
.I addr_len
was wrong, or the socket was not in the
.B AF_UNIX
family.
.TP
.B EROFS
The socket inode would reside on a read-only file system.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I my_addr
points outside your accessible address space.
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.I my_addr
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The file does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
.TP
.B ELOOP
.I my_addr
contains a circular reference (i.e., via a symbolic link)
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, 4.4BSD (the
.B bind
function first appeared in BSD 4.2).  SVr4 documents additional
EADDRNOTAVAIL, EADDRINUSE, ENOSR general error conditions, and
additional EIO, EISDIR and EROFS Unix-domain error conditions.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR accept "(2), " connect "(2), " listen "(2), "
.BR socket "(2), " getsockname (2)
