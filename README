Documentation
-------------

As of version 0.7.3, all of the documentation is provided in HTML form only.
This is mainly because maintaining two sets of documentation is a hassle,
and HTML is easier to navigate. If this is inconvenient, please e-mail me and
I'll add more text-file documentation. See the file "html/lsck.htm" for the
HTML documentation.

reports or problems, please mail me, and I'll see what I can do.
