Hello.

    I'd like to announce libsocket 0.7.3, the latest version of a BSD-style
socket library for DJGPP. libsocket uses Windows 3.x and '95's networking
services to provide networking functions to programs running in a DOS box
under Windows. It is primarily intended for TCP/IP networking, but sockets
using other protocols can be created.

    libsocket programs should be able to auto-configure itself to a certain
extent by obtaining Windows's TCP/IP settings. It also comes with a
configuration program, Netsetup, that should ease configuration when this
fails.

    It comes with some example programs and a large amount of socket function
documentation (man and HTML pages). A FAQ is also included. I've tried to
anticipate many questions, but I'm sure it doesn't answer all of them. Some
pointers to further sources of information about socket programming are
provided. All the libsocket documentation is on the Web.

    This release is mainly a tidy-up release before I add packet driver
support, but it also fixes many small bugs - please see the libsocket home
page for the changelog. The auto-configuration of the library has been tested
and fixed, but is limited.

    libsocket is distributed under the GNU Library General Public License
(LGPL). It is available from the libsocket home page at:

    http://libsocket.home.ml.org/

Note that the home page has changed again, but this should be its final URL.
This will redirect to wherever it actually is.

    Hopefully libsocket 0.7.3 will appear on the DJGPP archive soon.

    If you have any questions relating to libsocket, please mail me and I'll
be happy to help.

    Thanks,
