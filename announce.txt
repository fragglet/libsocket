Hello.

I'd like to announce the release of libsocket 0.8.0, a BSD-style
socket library for DJGPP. A lot of work has been done since the release of
libsocket 0.7.3. libsocket 0.8.0 is actually the final release of
the 0.7.4 betas.

There are too many changes to list here. If you use libsocket, you should
upgrade to version 0.8.0.

libsocket 0.8.0 is available from the Simtelnet archive in the v2tk directory:

    ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2tk/ls080b.zip
    ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2tk/ls080d.zip
    ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2tk/ls080s.zip

Please join the mailing list, if you want to keep up with bug reports,
developments, development snapshots, etc. If you have any questions relating
to libsocket, please mail me and I'll be happy to help.

Thanks, bye,
