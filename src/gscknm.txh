@comment The start of a comment is indicated by the following comment. This
@comment syntax is used by the script functxh.sh: @comment function <name>

@comment function getsockname

@node getsockname, socket
@findex getsockname

@subheading Syntax

@example
#include <sys/socket.h>

int getsockname (int s, struct sockaddr *name, size_t *namelen);
@end example

@subheading Description

@code{getsockname()} returns the local name of the socket @var{s}.
@var{namelen} should be set to the size of the space pointed to by
@var{name}.  On completion @var{namelen} will contain the length of the
address returned.  If the buffer is too small, the address is truncated to
fit.

@code{getpeername()} returns the peer name for the socket
(@pxref{getpeername}).

@subheading Return Value

On successful completion the function returns 0.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is
returned and @var{errno} is set appropriately.
