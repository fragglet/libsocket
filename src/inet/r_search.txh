@subheading Syntax

@example
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/nameser.h>
#include <resolv.h>

extern struct state _res;

int res_search(const char *dname, int class, int type,
               unsigned char *answer, int anslen);
@end example

@subheading Description

The @code{res_search()} function makes a query and waits for the response
like @code{res_query()} (@pxref{res_query}, but in addition implements the
default and search rules controlled by @samp{RES_DEFNAMES} and
@samp{RES_DNSRCH} (see description of @samp{_res} with @code{res_query()}
(@pxref{res_query})).

@subheading Return Value

The @code{res_search()} function returns the length of the response,
or -1 if an error occurs.

@subheading Portability

This function is not portable.  It is taken from Linux's libc 5 and so may be
portable to Linux.
