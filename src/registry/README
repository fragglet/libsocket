Registry Code Readme
====================

    The registry access code is from The RegDos Group's Regdos library. Alfons
Hoogervorst <alfons@hoogervorst.demon.nl> is the maintainer of this. I think
RegDos can be obtained from http://www.hoogervorst.demon.nl.

    In incorporating the RegDos code into libsocket, I made a couple of
changes - these are described in the source code itself.
