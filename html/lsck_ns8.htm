NAME
       netsetup - libsocket Library Networking Set-Up

SYNOPSIS
       netsetup

DESCRIPTION
       netsetup  sets  up  various  configuration  files for lib-
       socket.

       netsetup is an interactive program that  creates  versions
       of host.conf, resolv.conf and hosts, because these are not
       usually  present  on  Windows  '95  computers.  These  are
       required for libsocket's networking to function correctly.
       The files created need to moved and renamed to the Windows
       directory, usually C:\WINDOWS.

       In order to create the files, netsetup needs the following
       information:

              Your computer's name and IP address

              Your domain name

              Whether there is a DNS server and  its  IP  address
              (if applicable)

       The first piece of information is used to create the hosts
       file. The remainder is used to create  the  host.conf  and
       resolv.conf files.

       The  hosts file created contains entries for localhost and
       whatever name you entered for your computer. This file  is
       used  to  resolve names when no DNS server is present - it
       is used to translate names to IP addresses, e.g.  myserver
       -(gt) 192.168.0.2.

       If there is no DNS server present, then netsetup will tell
       libsocket to use the hosts file for name resolution before
       using a DNS server. If one is present, then the order will
       be reversed.
