NAME
       networks  - the network name to network IP address mapping
       file

DESCRIPTION
       This file tells the host name resolver the network  compo-
       nent  of an IP address corresponding to each network name.
       This is useful if there is no DNS server on  the  network.
       It  can  also  be  used  if the DNS server does not have a
       record for a particular network name, but its  IP  address
       is known.

       The  file is a plain ASCII file. Comments are denoted by a
       hash at the start of a line. Each line has  the  following
       format:

              (lt)IP address(gt) (lt)network name(gt) (lt)alias(gt)

       e.g.
              # networks - network name to IP address translation
              file
              127       loopback
              192.168.0 mynet intranet

       There should always be a line refering to loopback.   This
       is the loopback device, and is always accessible.

       Note  1: Windows doesn't use the aliases, so you will need
       multiple lines for the same network  IP  address  to  fake
       aliasing.

       Note  2: The network IP address can be constructed from an
       IP address and network  mask,  e.g.  if  you  have  an  IP
       address  of  1.2.3.4  and  a  netmask of 255.255.0.0, then
       AND'ing them gives a network IP address of 1.2.
