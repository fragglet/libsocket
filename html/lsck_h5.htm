NAME
       host.conf - configures the order of name resolving

DESCRIPTION
       This  file  tells  the  networking  libraries  which  name
       resolving resources to use, and in what order.

       Valid sources are hosts, bind and nis.   hosts  refers  to
       the  file  hosts,  which  contains name to IP address map-
       pings.  bind refers to DNS servers, which  are  configured
       elsewhere  (resolv.conf - see <A HREF="lsck_r5.htm">resolver(5)</A>).  nis refers to
       Network Information Services, which probably won't be very
       common  in  a Windows environment, but might be present if
       Unix hosts are used.

       If you have DNS servers, the  recommended  order  is  bind
       then hosts, i.e.

              order bind, hosts

       If  you  don't  have  a  DNS  server,  then  only hosts is
       required, like so:

              order hosts

       If you specify bind as well as hosts without a DNS server,
       then programs are likely to stall when resolving names.

FILES
