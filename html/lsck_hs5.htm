NAME
       hosts - the host name to IP address mapping file

DESCRIPTION
       This file tells the host name resolver the IP address cor-
       responding to each host name. This is useful if  there  is
       no  DNS  server on the network. It can also be used if the
       DNS server does not have a record for  a  particular  host
       name, but its IP address is known.

       The  file is a plain ASCII file. Comments are denoted by a
       hash at the start of a line. Each line has  the  following
       format:

              (lt)IP address(gt) (lt)host name(gt)

       e.g.
              # hosts - host name to IP address translation file
              127.0.0.1   localhost
              192.168.0.2 gertrude
              192.168.0.3 herbert
              192.168.0.4 norman

       There should always be a line refering to localhost.  This
       is the local computer, and is always accessible.
