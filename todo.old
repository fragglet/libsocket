libsocket 0.7.4 Beta 4 Old To-dos
=================================

- select() with fileno(stdin) + socket doesn't complete on key-press?
. This seems to work for me now I'm using select() properly!
+++WEIRD

- Need to add detection for Windows 'NT to __wsock_init().
. Use INT 0x2F, AX=0x1600 in addition to AX=0x160A.
. Could look at Allegro code too.
. 0x160A returns with AX != 0 => call not supported, should tell libsocket
  that it needs to put more effort in to finding a solution.
. Later: Actually, DOS version call _get_dos_version() == 0x532 => Windows NT.
  This needs checking. Does it work with Win2K?
. WinNT/2k indistinguishable via this method.
+++DONE - code tested & works.

- Windows version check - EliZ, __dpmi_int() rather than int86() - see
  DJGPP FAQ.
+++DONE

- Winsock code should also handle Win3.x address override - just has code for
  Win95 at mo!
+++SORTED

- Some network cards have their details under PCI not Root key? Aaargh, ugly
  hack.
. Discovered while using VMware.
+++SORTED

- Update list of req'd packages.

  + man, man12b.zip or later
  + GNU groff, gro110b.zip or later
. To build from sources, require additional packages to above:
  + GNU sed, sed118b.zip or later
  + GNU shellutils, shl112b.zip or later
  + GNU textutils, txt122b.zip or later
  + Perl - Only ActivePerl has been tested, see http://www.activeware.com/
  + GNU awk (for autoconf?)
  + GNU autoconf (")

+++DONE

- Cross-compiling notes:
	CC=/usr/local/bin/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp-gcc		\
	AR=/usr/local/bin/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp-ar			\
	./config	 --target=i586-pc-msdosdjgpp		\
			--enable-debug				\
			--prefix=/usr/local/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp

- Install guide for SOCK.VXD - should be installed as "dynamically loaded"!
. It's already described - need to mention SOCK.VXD installation in install
  guide.
+++DONE

- Write changelog for 0.7.4b4.
+++DONE

- Switch to @portability from portability section.
+++DONE

- 'bindist' & 'srcdist' targets for make'ing binary and source dists?
. Put both targets in Makefile.src
. Nope, obseleted, do by hand, by new install makes it a lot easier.
+++SORTED

- Doc autoconf script
+++DONE

- Doc SIGPIPE, EPIPE on sendto() page.
. Fix ref's to select() too.
. Doc gethostname(), sethostname(). +++DONE
+++DONE

- Doc loopback network.
+++DONE

- Update docs with new install (sockvxd.exe) & compile instructions.
+++DONE

- Win98 - ENODEV error on sending data (Marcin Laszewski)
. Hmm, can't see anything in code that looks weird.
+++SORTED, he made a mistake.

- Return codes on socketpair().
+++OK, actually did properly 1st time.

- Two spaces after period ending sentence - typesetting depends on it.
+++DONE

- Bug in parsing configs due to JW?
. Fixed, but needs testing. Check whether putting spaces before & after =
  breaks parsing.
+++DONE, works

- Update config docs with auto-config changes?
. Include standard configure doc? - Later: Couldn't find it!
. Need to doc configure script anyhow.
+++DONE

- Update netsetup to allow upto MAXNS DNS IP addresses.
. Done, needs testing.
+++DONE

- Do we need shellutils to build?
+++YES, documented

- Fix copyright message problem at the start of the netsetup manual, like
  in the libsocket manual.
+++DONE

- End-user guide should say that Windows '95, etc. TCP/IP stack should be
  installed!
. Good guides to installing TCP/IP?
+++DONE

- demo/solist.c needs to include errno.h - also sys/time.h, sys/types.h? (for
  Linux)
+++DONE

- Add to buglist problem with IAMDRV.
+++DONE

- Sort out copyright message in libsocket docs for info, HTML.
+++DONE

- Update compliance info on functions.
+++DONE, I think.

- Y2k probs in web pages?
. Nope
+++OK

- Generate include/lsck/copyrite.h automatically?
+++NAAH

- SOCK.VXD bug? sys_send() returns length sent in EAX & ECX. The EAX return
  makes main SOCK.VXD code think that an error has occurred. Clearly the
  length only needs to be returned in ECX & EAX can only be used for errors.
. Fixed? Doc'd certainly. Ask JW.
. Also problem with speed of send()s, recv()s.
. Problem only seems to be with recv() now!
+++FORGOTTEN what the hell I was on about.

- Doc comp's taken from DJGPP's libc & their licence.
+++DONE

- Debugging tips for libsocket - USE HARDWARE-ASSISTED BREAKPOINTS! It's a
  nightmare to try and debug __wsock_*() otherwise.
. Maybe have to resort to actual offsets? *0x....
+++DONE

- UPDATE THE DOCUMENTATION!
. Add compliance info.
. Started
+++DONE

- Document how to use libsocket without actually installing it.
+++NAAAH - who cares?

- diag.exe crashes under NT?
. Is this true of all libsocket programs under Windows NT?
. Seems to be, on exit.
+++DOC'D, both in docs & bugzilla.

- Doc fact you need to have /bin/sh set up on the drive you have libsocket
  installed on, in order for the shell scripts to work.
. Still true? Maybe this is why tools/mkconfig.sh doesn't work?
+++NO, bash should handle this.

- Add required packages for building binary distribution (add depends-on reqs
  in DSM).
+++DONE

- Document copyright information provided
+++DONE

- bash 2.03 sets $HOSTNAME -> setting in config file is ignored?
. Bogus, my _bashrc had a line.
+++OK, documented how the host name is learnt in gethostname().
+++Sorted, added another note to the docs.

Release Notes
-------------

- Assembler warnings with binutils 2.9.5.1 OK.
+++DONE
